    <p id="para">I see trees of green, red roses too<br>
    I see them bloom for me and for you<br>
    And I think to myself<br>
    What a wonderful world<br>
    I see skies of blue and clouds of white<br>
    The bright blessed days, dark sacred nights<br>
    And I think to myself<br>
    What a wonderful world<br>
    The colors of the rainbow, so pretty in the sky<br>
    Are also on the faces of people going by<br>
    I see friends shaking hands, saying, "How do you do?"<br>
    They are really sayin', "I love you"<br>
    I hear babies cry, I watch them grow<br>
    They will learn much more than I'll never know<br>
    And I think to myself<br>
    What a wonderful world<br>
    Yes, I think to myself<br>
    What a wonderful world</p>
